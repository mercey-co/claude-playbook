# Quality Control

Run a full pre-commit quality control using the best available agents.  
Check for unused code, duplicated code, redundant logic, interface compliance, security, and performance issues.  
Block commit if any criteria are not satisfied.  

Refer to the instructions located in @~/.claude/instructions/pre-commit-quality.md
